## Description
Convenient wallpaper manager supporting both GUI and CLI usage.
I want to make it as fast, convenient and pleasing to the eye as possible.

Keep in mind that the application is being developed and tested on and for linux systems.
I will try to keep it running on other platforms as well, but this is not a priority.

Looks like a piece of shit, right?
It's all nailed down, and it lags at high resolutions.
Soon I'll move all renderings to GPU, and make previews adaptive.
