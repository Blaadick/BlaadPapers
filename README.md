## Description
Convenient wallpaper manager supporting both GUI and CLI usage.
I will try to make it as fast and pleasing to the eye as possible.

Keep in mind that the application is being developed and tested on and for linux systems.
I will try to keep it running on other platforms as well, but this is not a priority.
